<h1 align="center">Donation via WordPress plugin</h1> 
<p>By using the following address, I think you can donate to me probably :<br> 
<br> 
<a href="http://nowsmartsoft.wp.xdomain.jp/2020/01/26/testforpaypaldonationplugin/">http://nowsmartsoft.wp.xdomain.jp/2020/01/26/testforpaypaldonationplugin/</a><br> 
<br> 
It is made with PayPal and WordPress donations plugin.<br> 
The reason why I wrote &quot;probably&quot; in the sentence above is that since it can't be  
used from Japan, I can't test it.<br>  
First, donation with PayPal can't be used in Japan by using normal ways.<br> 
Second, normally buy-now-button can be created in the PayPal HomePage by using  
Button Making Tool. <br> 
But only Donation Button in the listbox for the Button Making Tool does not  
appear in Japan PayPal HomePage.<br> 
So Japanese can't create donation Button by using the Button Making Tool.<br> 
Third, though there are such difficulty as I've written above, somehow the  
donation plugin for WordPress can be used in Japan, too.<br> 
That is very the above linked WebPage.<br> 
I've tested the above linked WebPage just until I reached about the end of the  
way.<br> 
But I can't know whether the whole things works fine.</p>
